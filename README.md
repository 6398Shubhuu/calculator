Introduction
This is a Python program that implements a scientific calculator using the Tkinter library. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations as well as various scientific functions such as square root, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more.

Key Concepts
Tkinter: Tkinter is a Python library used for creating GUI applications. It provides a set of tools and widgets for building graphical user interfaces.
Classes: The program defines a class called Calci that encapsulates the calculator's functionality. The class has methods for performing arithmetic operations, handling input, and displaying the result.
Event-driven programming: The calculator responds to user input by binding functions to button clicks. When a button is clicked, the corresponding function is executed.
Code Structure


The code is structured as follows:

Import necessary libraries: The code begins by importing the tkinter, math, and tkinter.messagebox libraries.
Create the main window: The code creates the main window for the calculator using the Tk() function from the tkinter library. It sets the title, background color, and size of the window.
Define the Calci class: The code defines a class called Calci that represents the calculator. The class has methods for handling user input, performing calculations, and displaying the result.
Create the calculator interface: The code creates the user interface for the calculator using the Frame and Button widgets from the tkinter library. It also creates an Entry widget for displaying the input and output.
Bind functions to buttons: The code binds the methods of the Calci class to the buttons on the calculator interface. When a button is clicked, the corresponding method is executed.
Create a menu: The code creates a menu bar with options for switching between standard and scientific modes, as well as an option to exit the program.
Run the main event loop: The code enters the main event loop, which listens for user input and updates the display accordingly.
